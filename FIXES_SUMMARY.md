# Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Infinite Loop in Event Creation
**Problem**: "Maximum update depth exceeded" error when creating events
**Root Cause**: Multiple useEffect hooks with improper dependency arrays causing infinite re-renders

**Fixes Applied**:
- Fixed `Layout.jsx` useEffect dependency array to only watch specific fields: `[user, profileLoading, profile?.dept]`
- Fixed `ProfileForm.jsx` useEffect to be more specific about dependencies: `[initialData?.id, user?.uid, user?.displayName, user?.photoURL, user?.email]`
- Added safety counter in `AuthContext.js` to prevent infinite username generation loops
- Fixed `NotificationToast.jsx` to only depend on `notifications.length` instead of the entire notifications array

### 2. File Upload Issues
**Problem**: File uploads not working anywhere in the application
**Root Cause**: EventCreationForm was using placeholder URLs instead of actually uploading to Firebase Storage

**Fixes Applied**:
- Updated `EventCreationForm.jsx` to properly upload poster images to Firebase Storage
- Added proper error handling for file uploads with user feedback
- Implemented two-step process: create event first, then upload and update with poster URL
- Added import for `uploadEventPoster` from storage service

### 3. Additional Improvements
- Added controlled/uncontrolled state support for EventCreationForm dialog
- Improved error handling and user feedback for file uploads
- Added safety measures to prevent infinite loops in various components

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/Layout.jsx` - Fixed infinite loop in profile check
2. `src/components/ProfileForm.jsx` - Fixed useEffect dependencies
3. `src/components/EventCreationForm.jsx` - Fixed file upload functionality
4. `src/contexts/AuthContext.js` - Added safety counter for username generation
5. `src/components/NotificationToast.jsx` - Fixed notification toast dependencies

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test event creation with and without poster images
2. Test profile completion flow
3. Verify file uploads work for profile pictures and cover photos
4. Check that notifications don't cause infinite loops
5. Test the app in both desktop and mobile layouts

## Next Steps

If issues persist:
1. Check browser console for any remaining errors
2. Verify Firebase Storage rules allow uploads
3. Test with different file types and sizes
4. Monitor network requests to ensure uploads are attempted
